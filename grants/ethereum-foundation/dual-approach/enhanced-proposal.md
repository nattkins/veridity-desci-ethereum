# Ethereum Foundation Grant Proposal: Veridity DeSci - Dual Implementation Approach

## 🎯 Enhanced Project Overview

**Veridity transforms academic publishing from a $25,000 cartel-controlled system to a $2.50 cryptographically-verified platform using a dual implementation approach that maximizes both immediate impact and long-term ecosystem contribution.**

### 🚀 Dual Path Strategy

**Approach 1: Rapid POC (Immediate Impact)**
- **Timeline:** 2 weeks deployment, 1 month optimization
- **Technology:** Existing Ethereum tools (ENS + EAS + IPFS + USDC) via n8n workflows
- **Purpose:** Immediate university adoption, stakeholder validation, grant milestone delivery

**Approach 2: Custom Contracts (Ecosystem Contribution)**  
- **Timeline:** 6 months development, 3 months auditing
- **Technology:** Custom Solidity contracts optimized for academic workflows
- **Purpose:** Long-term DeSci infrastructure, maximum customization, ecosystem advancement

**Both approaches serve the same users with identical experiences while offering different technical trade-offs.**

## 💡 Why This Dual Approach Strengthens Our Grant Application

### **Technical Credibility**
