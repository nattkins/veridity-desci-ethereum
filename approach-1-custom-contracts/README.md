## 🔧 Development Process
1. **Review Pseudocode:** All specifications in `/contracts/specifications/`
2. **Implement Contracts:** Convert pseudocode to Solidity
3. **Comprehensive Testing:** Follow test specifications
4. **Security Auditing:** Professional audit before mainnet
5. **University Deployment:** Full institutional integration

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
cd approach-1-custom-contracts
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npm run test
npm run deploy:testnet
```

See `/contracts/specifications/` for complete pseudocode ready for implementation.
