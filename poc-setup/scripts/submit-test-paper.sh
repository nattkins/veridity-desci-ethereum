    "content": {
        "introduction": "Academic fraud is a growing concern in the research community. Traditional peer review processes are insufficient to detect sophisticated manipulation of data and conclusions.",
        "methodology": "We used statistical analysis combined with natural language processing to identify inconsistencies between quantitative results and qualitative conclusions. Our sample size was n=200 participants.",
        "results": "Our analysis showed a correlation of r=0.23 (p=0.14) between measured variables. The effect size was small but consistent across multiple trials.",
        "conclusion": "The results indicate a weak, non-significant relationship between the variables studied. This finding suggests that the effect, while measurable, may not be practically significant."
