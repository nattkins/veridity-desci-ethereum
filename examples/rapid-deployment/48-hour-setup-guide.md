- Plan migration to custom contracts if needed

## üí° Success Tips

### **Pre-deployment Preparation**
- Ensure all API keys and credentials ready before starting
- Have university stakeholder availability for testing
- Prepare sample academic papers for demonstration
- Setup monitoring and alerting from hour 1

### **During Deployment**
- Follow timeline strictly - each hour builds on previous
- Test each component before moving to next phase
- Document any deviations or customizations needed
- Keep university stakeholders informed of progress

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- Don't skip testing external API connections early
- Ensure sufficient Sepolia ETH for testing transactions
- Verify ENS domain ownership before configuration
- Test fraud detection with both clean and suspicious papers

**Result: Live academic publishing system on Ethereum in 48 hours!** üöÄ
